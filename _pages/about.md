## 🔐 Project Idea

This project explores the evolution of cryptographic methods from classical ciphers like the Caesar shift and Vigenère cipher to modern quantum cryptography protocols such as BB84. It also investigates how foundational ideas in classical cryptography—like randomness, key distribution, and modular arithmetic—continue to influence and inspire innovations in quantum cryptography.

## 📚 Background + Motivation

From Caesar ciphers to RSA, cryptography has always been about finding clever ways to hide information using math.  
Now with quantum computers on the horizon, a lot of classical methods might break—yet surprisingly, the old ideas still matter. I want to explore how classical cryptography laid the foundation for quantum cryptography, and how those “ancient” concepts like modular arithmetic, randomness, and key exchange still show up in protocols like BB84. I think it’s pretty cool that even as the math gets more futuristic, some of it still starts with the same basic ideas.

## 🎯 Goals + Future Plans

This project connects to my long-term goals of studying mathematics and theoretical computer science—especially cryptography, quantum algorithms, and information theory.  
After MathQuantum, I want to dive deeper into research in quantum information science and help build secure systems for a quantum future.  
To me, this project is a perfect mix of old-school math and cutting-edge tech—and that’s the kind of work I want to keep doing.
