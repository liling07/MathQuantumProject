## 🔐 Project Idea

This project explores the evolution of cryptographic methods from classical ciphers like the Caesar shift and Vigenère cipher to modern quantum cryptography protocols such as BB84 to spark ideas regarding further research / extentions towards quantum cryptography.

## 📚 Background + Motivation

I want to explore how classical cryptography laid the foundation for quantum cryptography, and how those “ancient” concepts like modular arithmetic, randomness, and key exchange still show up in protocols like BB84. I think it’s pretty cool that even as the math gets more futuristic, some of it still starts with the same basic ideas.

## 🎯 Goals + Future Plans

This project connects to my long-term goals of studying mathematics and theoretical computer science—especially cryptography, quantum algorithms, and information theory.  Additionally, cryptography has always been a big interest of mine, so I wanted to take this chance to do a bit of exploration. After MathQuantum, I want to dive deeper into research in quantum cryptography, and potentially create a personal project related to it.
