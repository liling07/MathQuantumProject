## Classical Ã— Quantum: The Intersection

Even though quantum cryptography feels futuristic, itâ€™s built on the same questions classical cryptographers have asked for centuries â€” how do we keep secrets safe, and how do we know if someoneâ€™s listening in?  At their core, both approaches rely on math, uncertainty, and clever tricks to stay one step ahead.

### ðŸ§ª Potential Research / Extensions

- Explore **post-quantum cryptographic algorithms** (like lattice-based or code-based encryption)
- Compare **error correction** methods in classical vs. quantum communication systems
- Investigate **quantum-safe variants** of classical protocols (e.g., quantum-resistant RSA alternatives)
- Simulate BB84 vs. RSA in Python and analyze their **strengths under quantum attack models**
- Design a hybrid system that **uses quantum key distribution to secure classical encryption**
- Study the **mathematical limits of randomness**: PRNGs vs. quantum randomness
- Explore **zero-knowledge proofs** in classical and quantum frameworks
- Research how **quantum computers could break or accelerate** classical cryptanalysis
