## üï∞Ô∏è A Brief Timeline of Classical Cryptography

| Year      | Event                          | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~58 BCE   | Caesar Cipher                  | A monoalphabetic substitution cipher used by Julius Caesar to send secret military messages. It shifted each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet, laying one of the earliest foundations for cryptographic thinking. |
| 1467      | Alberti Cipher Disk            | Considered the first polyalphabetic cipher, it introduced the idea of switching between cipher alphabets during encryption, drastically increasing security against frequency analysis. Created by Leon Battista Alberti, it's often referred to as the birth of modern cryptography. |
| 1854      | Playfair Cipher                | Developed by Charles Wheatstone and popularized by Lord Playfair, this cipher used digraphs (letter pairs) to complicate decryption. It was notably used during World War I due to its simplicity and effectiveness without the need for complex machinery. |
| 1977      | RSA Algorithm                  | Developed by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, RSA was the first widely used public-key cryptosystem. It revolutionized secure digital communication by enabling encryption and digital signatures based on number theory, particularly the difficulty of factoring large integers. |
