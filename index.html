Project Idea
This project explores the evolution of cryptographic methods from classical ciphers like the Caesar shift and Vigenère cipher to modern quantum cryptography protocols such as BB84. 
It also investigates how foundational ideas in classical cryptography—like randomness, key distribution, and modular arithmetic—continue to influence and inspire innovations in quantum cryptography.

Background + Motivation
From Caesar ciphers to RSA, cryptography has always been about finding clever ways to hide information using math. Now with quantum computers on the horizon, a lot of classical methods might break—yet surprisingly, the old ideas still matter. I want to explore how classical cryptography laid the foundation for quantum cryptography, and how those “ancient” concepts like modular arithmetic, randomness, and key exchange still show up in protocols like BB84. I think it’s pretty cool that even as the math gets more futuristic, some of it still starts with the same basic ideas.

Goals + Future Plans
This project connects to my long-term goals of studying mathematics and theoretical computer science, particularly topics like cryptography, quantum algorithms, and information theory. I hope to contribute to building secure systems in a world where classical assumptions may no longer hold. After MathQuantum, I plan to pursue more advanced coursework and potentially research in quantum information science, using this project as a bridge between historical mathematical ideas and cutting-edge technologies.
