## Classical Ã— Quantum: The Intersection

Even though quantum cryptography feels futuristic, through this exploration, I've came up with some ideas to extend and research more about quantum cryptography.

### ðŸ§ª Potential Research / Extensions

- Explore **post-quantum cryptographic algorithms** (like lattice-based or code-based encryption)
- Compare **error correction** methods in classical vs. quantum communication systems
- Design a hybrid system that **uses quantum key distribution to secure classical encryption**
- Study the **mathematical limits of randomness**: PRNGs vs. quantum randomness
- Research how **quantum computers could break or accelerate** classical cryptanalysis
